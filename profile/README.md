# Hello!
The Police Data Accessibility Project is a nonprofit based in Pittsburgh, PA.

We help people learn about the police through public records from the criminal legal system&mdash;law enforcement, courts, and jails. We do this by locating and documenting sources of data on the internet, helping people make records requests, and writing web scrapers.

To learn more, head to [pdap.io](https://pdap.io).
