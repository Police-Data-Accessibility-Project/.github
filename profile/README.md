# Hello!
The Police Data Accessibility Project is a nonprofit based in Pittsburgh, PA.

We help people answer questions about the police through public records from the criminal legal system&mdash;law enforcement, courts, and jails. We do this by locating and documenting sources of data on the internet, helping people make records requests, writing web scrapers, and facilitating collaboration between people working on their local systems.

To learn more, request data, volunteer, or donate, head to [pdap.io](https://pdap.io).
